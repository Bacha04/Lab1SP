President Joe Biden has vowed continued US support for Ukraine, after further military funding was excluded from a last-minute congressional budget deal.
The temporary measure, pushed through to avert a government shutdown, did not include   in military aid for Kyiv - a top White House priority.
Hardline Republicans oppose further military aid, with many openly opposing Mr Biden's approach to the war.
But on Sunday Mr Biden said Ukraine could "count on" US support.
"We cannot, under any circumstances, allow US support to Ukraine to be interrupted," Mr Biden said.
I can reassure  we'll get there, that we're going to get it done, he said on restoring funding for the war. "I want to assure our American allies... that you can count on our support, we will not walk away.
The US has already supplied some  in military aid to Ukraine since Russian launched its full scale invasion in February 2022.
President Biden has requested another.
